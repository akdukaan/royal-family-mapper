TODO:
Fix an issue where some people can have three parents because Wiki is using links that redirect. ex. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Pavlovna_of_WÃ¼rttemberg shows up as a parent for someone but then clicking on it leads to someone who already exists so we have 2 copies of the same person.
