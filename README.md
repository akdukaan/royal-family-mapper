**TODO: Fix some pages have spouse names in the children section.**

Example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Kostka has the name Zofia in the Issue section

Example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Leopold_Prinz_von_Sachsen-Coburg_und_Gotha and click Mother

Solution: Only count it as a child if the href is the only thing in that text line
